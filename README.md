# <span style="color:blue; font-size:28px">K-means Clustering on Iris Dataset</span>

This repository contains Python code demonstrating the application of K-means clustering algorithm from scikit-learn to the famous Iris dataset. 

In this project, we explore how K-means clustering can be utilized for unsupervised learning tasks and how it can effectively segment data points into distinct clusters based on their features.

## <span style="color:green; font-size:20px">Iris Dataset</span>

The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, 
each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 

The goal is to classify each sample into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. 

This dataset is commonly used for exploring classification and clustering algorithms.

## <span style="color:red; font-size:18px">About the Code</span>

The Python code provided in this repository demonstrates how to perform K-means clustering on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. It includes the following steps:

1. Loading the Iris dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets.
2. Preprocessing the data (optional).
3. Applying K-means clustering algorithm.
4. Visualizing the clusters using matplotlib.
5. Finding the oftimal nmber off clusters.
6. Exploring the effect of the parameter n_init.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a reference for implementing clustering algorithms in other projects.
